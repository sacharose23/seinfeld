# _Java Script Basics_ with TeamTreehouse   

##**_Introducing Javascript_**
**4/23/16: 1 hour**  
**TOPICS** 
- Javascript as versatile language (roles in web servers, websites, desktop apps, etc.)  
- Importance of CodeMonkey Vocabulary (syntax, dialog box, etc.)  
- Browsers Role in Code (debugging, console usages, javascript interpreter reads/runs/executes js file)  
- script tags in html file and js file
- console.log function & its roles
- alert function, document.write function  
- Analogy of variables as boxes  
- Assigning values to variables  
- js list of reserved words  
- _Camelcasing_ (eg. pricePerPound as a var name)    
  

##**_Storing & Tracking Information with Variables_**
**5/2/16: 1 hour**  
 **TOPICS** 
- \ backlash usage for ignoring quotes in a string
- Utilizing spaces as a way to make your code easier to understand  
- Concatenation: adding strings together with + sign  
- The idea of UPDATing a variable by ACCESSing a variabe  
- += usage  
- MDN: Mozilla Developer Network --> great documentation resource for javascript   
- Objects (nouns), Properties (adjectives), & Methods (functions/actions) 
- methods()  <-- ()  indication of command/method 

##**_Working with Numbers_**
**5/4/16: 1 hour**  
 **TOPICS**  
 - floating numbers, integers, scientific notation
 - operators  
 - Mathematical Shorthands += , -= , *= , /=  
 - parseInt(varName) --> used to convert strings to integers  
 - parseFloat
 - Use console to type js & preview your work immediately  
 - CountDown project...Duplication/Dry Programming  
 - JS is made up of many Objects  
 - The Math Object (has properties & methods) -> example: Math.round(x)....PI...Math.random()...  
 - Math.random() --> generates a floating number from 0 (inclusive) to 1 (exclusive)  
 - Math.floor() --> rounds the number up...Math.ceil() rounds up.  
 - Math.floor( Math.random() * 6 ) + 1 ---> to get a random number from 1 to 6 (like rolling a die)    


##**_Introducing Conditional Statements_**
**5/8/16: 30 min**  
**TOPICS**   
- Decision-making                              
- if (condition ) { then statement } -- No semicolon after the conditional statement.  
- === triple equal operator
- right after "if" clause, you can insert an "else" clause  
- if ( ) {
	
} else {
	
}  
- Other comparison operators 
- Example ('apple' < 'bear') is TRUE because alphabetically, 'apple' comes before 'bear'  
= Example ('3'==3) is TRUE b/c interpreter converts the string into a number and compares HOWEVER stricter the equal operator...
('3'=== 3) is FALSE since a string does not equal a number.  
- Javascript is case-sensitive  
- Better to use !== (strict NOT equal operator)
